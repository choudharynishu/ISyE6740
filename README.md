Different Machine Learning Algorithms taught during ISyE 6740 Computational Data Analysis course @Georgia Tech
## About
Here are implementations of some algorithms I learned during machine learning courses taught at Georgia Tech.
These implementations helped me get a better grasp of the algorithms. Most of the implementations here are developed from scratch.
